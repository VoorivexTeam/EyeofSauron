# EyeofSauron

A simple Django application that monitors Hackerone programs and sends alerts to a Telegram channel when new programs and new scopes are detected.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a Telegram Bot

1. Message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) on Telegram
2. Use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot
3. Follow the instructions and obtain your `bot_token`

### 2. Get Your Channel/Group ID

1. Add [@myidbot](https://t.me/myidbot) to your Telegram channel or group
2. Run the `/getgroupid` command in the channel
3. Save the Group ID for configuration

### 3. Clone and Set Up the Project

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:VoorivexTeam/EyeofSauron.git
cd EyeofSauron

# Set up virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure the Django Application

```bash
# Set up the database
python3 manage.py makemigrations
python3 manage.py migrate

# Create an admin user
python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 5. Running the Application & Configuration

**If you are running it on a server for the first time, you need to access to the admin panel to configure the API keys,so run it with `0.0.0.0:8000` After that, change it to `127.0.0.1:8000` to avoid exposing the panel to the internet.**
Run the following commands in separate terminals (recommended in tmux):

```bash
# Start the Django server
python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --insecure

# For background tasks processing
python3 manage.py process_tasks

```

### 6. Set Up Keys and Initial Database and Programs

You can configure the bot token and channel ID in the application settings through the admin interface

Run the initial fetch to generate your database (It takes about 10 minutes):

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/watch/?debug=true
```

### 7. Set Up a Cron Job for Regular Updates

This application receives two query parameters. One is `debug`, which, if set to True, will execute the task without background tasks. However, if it is False, it will check the queue of background tasks, and if itâ€™s free, it will execute the task. This prevents the function from running multiple times and avoids hitting API limits and other issues
The second parameter is `logger`, which is set to False by default and is used to send changes to Telegram. Therefore, to send Telegram notifications, it must be set to True

for the 

To edit your crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
```

Add this to your crontab to check for new programs every 10 minutes:

```bash
*/10 * * * * echo "$(date) - $(/usr/bin/curl -s "http://localhost:8000/watch/?debug=false&logger=true")" >> /var/log/curl_job.log 2>&1
```
